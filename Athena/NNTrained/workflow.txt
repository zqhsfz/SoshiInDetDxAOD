1) Prepare raw NN weights. Put this in NNWeights/
2) Determine the PixelNNCalibFile corresponding to the condition tags you will use in your jobOption. Put that in PrepareCalibFiles/NNCalibFiles/
3) Convert NN weights to histograms, using code in PrepareCalibFiles/NNClusteringCalibration_RunII/doCalibration.C
4) Overwrite the calibration file in condition tags with your customized NN, through mergeCalibration.py in PrepareCalibFiles/ 
5) Ship the final calibration file to GUID/, and insert GUID to it
6) Ship the GUIDed calibration file to the Db/ directory under run/ in your reconstruction job
7) Adjust the buildDb.sh under Db/ to make sure you are accessing the right Db. Also make sure you are setting the appropriate tag and folder. Then you can build your db file with that script
8) move both calibration file and db in the running directory. Use "GridCatalogTrick.py" in "preInclude". Use "from IOVDbSvc.CondDB import conddb;etc." to do the operation you want
9) For pathena job on grid, don't forget to --extFile GridCatalogTrick.py,Calibration.root,db.db
